# teleportation_based_QKD_variants
This project is a Flask-based web application that simulates multiple Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols — namely BB84, E91, BBM92, and Teleportation-based QKD — using IBM’s Qiskit quantum computing framework. It provides an interactive and educational platform to understand how quantum mechanics can be applied to achieve secure communication
